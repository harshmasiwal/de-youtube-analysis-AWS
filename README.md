# De-Youtube-Analysis-AWS   

# üöÄ   üéìOverview:

**Perform analysis on the semi-structured YouTube video data based on the video categories and the trending metrics. Utilize AWS cloud services to ensure scalable storage, enhanced processing capabilities, and efficient data management.**



# üìà Project goal:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Ingestion** ‚Äî Develop a system to collect data from various sources.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **ETL System** ‚Äî We are receiving data in its raw format and need to transform it into a usable format.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Lake** ‚Äî Since we will be collecting data from multiple sources, we require a centralized repository for storage.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Scalability** ‚Äî As the size of our data grows, we must ensure that our system can scale accordingly.

# ü§î Data Source 

The Kaggle dataset is a comprehensive resource containing CSV files that provide statistics on popular YouTube videos over multiple months. Each day, up to 200 trending videos are published across various locations, with the data for each region stored in separate files. This dataset includes essential details such as video titles, channel titles, publication times, tags, views, likes, dislikes, descriptions, and comment counts. Moreover, a category_id field, which varies by region, is included in the JSON file linked to each location. This dataset is invaluable for anyone looking to analyze YouTube trends effectively.
