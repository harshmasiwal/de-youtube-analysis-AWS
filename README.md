# Project Goals

Utilize AWS cloud services to ensure scalable storage, enhanced processing capabilities, and efficient data management.

1. **Data Ingestion** — Develop a system to collect data from various sources.  
2. **ETL System** — We are receiving data in its raw format and need to transform it into a usable format.  
3. **Data Lake** — Since we will be collecting data from multiple sources, we require a centralized repository for storage.  
4. **Scalability** — As the size of our data grows, we must ensure that our system can scale accordingly.

 # Services Used 

1. **AWS IAM:** AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources.
